âœ… Day 2 â€“ Java Fundamentals
Covered variables, data types, operators, and basic input/output in Java.

âœ… Day 3 â€“ Control Flow
Practiced if-else, switch statements, and various loop structures (for, while, do-while).

âœ… Day 4 â€“ Arrays
Learned how to declare, initialize, and iterate through single-dimensional arrays.

âœ… Day 5 â€“ Strings
